## 📄 Document Shipping Details

Shipping documents internationally requires understanding the nature of the content and its implications on customs, insurance, and legal verification. Common types of documents shipped include:
- Legal contracts
- Educational certificates and transcripts
- Personal letters and identification documents

The **contents of the documents** determine:
- Whether customs duties apply (most personal documents are duty-free)
- Eligibility for **insurance coverage** in case of loss or damage
- Need for **identity verification** or ID upload, especially for sensitive documents like birth certificates, power of attorney, or immigration papers

Uploading an **ID proof** is optional but strongly recommended when shipping sensitive or government-related papers. It ensures smoother customs clearance and enhances trust in delivery accuracy and legal compliance.
