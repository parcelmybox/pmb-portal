**Document Shipping Requirements Between India and the USA**

**Permissible Contents -** Shipments classified as \"documents\" may
include most types of paper-based items such as:

- Birth certificates

- Contracts

- Invoices

- Educational transcripts

- Legal paperwork

These shipments must consist solely of paper materials. Items such as
USB drives, merchandise, or any non-paper objects do not qualify under
document shipping and must be sent through alternative channels.

**Weight Limitations -** Document shipments are generally required to
weigh under 2 kilograms. Proper packaging is essential to ensure the
safe and secure delivery of contents.

**Prohibited Items -** The shipment of physical currency---whether
Indian rupees, US dollars, or any other form---is strictly prohibited by
both Indian and US customs regulations.  
However, financial instruments such as cheques and demand drafts may be
permissible if they are appropriately declared and accompanied by the
required documentation.

**Declared Value -** Couriers typically allow a declared value of up to
approximately USD 100 for document-only shipments. This declared amount
is used primarily for insurance purposes and should represent the cost
of replacing the documents, excluding any sentimental or personal value.

**Required Documentation -** Even for document-only shipments, certain
paperwork is necessary:

- **Air Waybill (AWB):** The official shipping label.

- **Invoice:** A simple statement listing the contents of the shipment.

- **Identification Proof:** Often a PAN card is required from the
  > sender.

- **Customs Classification Code:** A Harmonized System (HS) code for
  > documents must be used for international customs processing.
