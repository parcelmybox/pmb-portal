## ‚öñÔ∏è Volumetric Weight

Couriers charge by actual or **volumetric weight**, whichever is higher.

**Formula (in cm):**  
`Volumetric Weight (kg) = (Length √ó Width √ó Height) / 5000`

**Example:**  
Box size = 60 x 40 x 30 cm  
Volumetric Weight = (60√ó40√ó30)/5000 = **14.4 kg**  
If actual weight is 5 kg, chargeable weight = **14.4 kg**

**Tip:**  
Use tight, compact packing to reduce volumetric weight.
